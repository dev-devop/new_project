PAYMENT APP: Create a separate app to handle payment-related functionalities.

Payment Model: 
    Within the Payment app, create a model to represent payment transactions.
    This model should include fields such as transaction ID, payment amount,
    payment status, customer information, timestamp, etc. This model will store
    the details of each payment transaction.

Payment Gateway Integration: 
    Integrate a payment gateway service such as Stripe,
    PayPal, or Braintree into your app. These services provide APIs
    and documentation to handle payment processing securely.
    
    Follow the integration guides and utilize the appropriate libraries
    or SDKs provided by the payment gateway service.

    credit card information,billing address, or any other required fields.

Order Integration:
    Integrate the payment process with your existing order model.

    Provide a view or API endpoint to display the transaction history for customers,
    showing details of their payments and wallet transactions.

Security Considerations:
    Implement necessary security measures to ensure the confidentiality
    and integrity of payment data. Use HTTPS for secure communication,
    encrypt sensitive information, and follow best practices for secure payment processing.
